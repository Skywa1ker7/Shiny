The actual code is in the "shinyps6" folder
The table widgets used in this app are basic slider that filter for certain length and width of sepals and petals of irises. 
The Histogram is more interesting it can filter for those measurements and adjust its bin size accoridng to the user's input. Lastly, I added colors with radioButtons to fullfill the visaul requirement of this project.
