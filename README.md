The actual code is in the "shinyps6" folder
The table widgets used in this app are basic sliders that filter for certain length and width of sepals and petals of irises. In result, users can play around with the filters to discover which species of irises have the longest/shortest sepals and petals
The Histogram is more interesting it can filter for those measurements and adjust its bin size accoridng to the user's input. Lastly, I added colors with radioButtons to fullfill the visual requirement of this project.
